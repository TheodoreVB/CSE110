### About me:
My name is Teddy Van Berlo, and I am currently a junior-transfer student at UCSD majoring in Computer Engineering. I have experience programming in C++ and Java, but heavily prefer using C++
over Java because `cout` is much superior to `System.out.print()`. My favorite fandom is Star Wars, in particular *The Mandalorian*.
